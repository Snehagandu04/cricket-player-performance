🏏 Cricket Player Performance Analysis

Hi there 👋 I'm Sneha Gandu, an aspiring Data Analyst.
This project is a simple and fun analysis of cricket player performance - built to practice data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and storytelling with Python.



🔍 Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze batting and bowling data to discover interesting insights about players, such as:

Who scores most consistently? 📈

Which bowlers take the most wickets? 🎯

How performance varies across different matches and formats ⚖

This project helped me practice real-world data analysis skills using Python and its popular libraries.



🧰 Skills & Tools Used

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📈 Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

🧮 Statistical Insights & Comparisons

🐍 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)



📂 Datasets

batting.csv → Contains players’ batting statistics (matches, runs, strike rate, etc.)

bowling.csv → Contains bowling statistics (overs, wickets, economy rate, etc.)

⚙ How to Run the Project

You can explore or run this project in two simple ways:

🧠 Option 1: View directly on GitHub

If you're just here to see my work, you can read through the code and outputs once I upload my analysis file - no setup needed!



💻 Option 2: Run it on your computer

If you’d like to try running the project yourself, follow these easy steps 👇

1. Download the files

Click the green Code button → Download ZIP

Extract the ZIP folder on your computer



2. Open the project in VS Code or Jupyter Notebook

You’ll see the data files: batting.csv and bowling.csv



3. Run the analysis (once uploaded)

Open the analysis file (analysis.py or .ipynb)

Run the code cells to see graphs and insights
