# 🏏 Cricket Player Performance Analysis

Hi there 👋 I'm **Sneha Gandu**, an aspiring Data Analyst.  
This project is a simple and fun analysis of cricket player performance — created to practice data analysis, visualization, and storytelling using Python.  

## 📘 Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze batting and bowling data to find interesting insights about players — like who scores consistently, who takes the most wickets, and how performance varies across matches.  

This project helped me practice:
- Data cleaning and reading datasets  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Creating visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  
- Interpreting data-driven insights clearly  

## 🗂️ Folder Structure
| Folder | Description |
| data| Contains the datasets batting.csv and bowling.csv |
| src | Python scripts for the analysis (analysis.py) |
| notebooks | Jupyter notebook for step-by-step exploration |
| images | Saved plots and graphs |

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Excel** (for data creation)
- **GitHub** (for project sharing)


## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the script using python src analysis.py
3. Open the notebook in jupyter
